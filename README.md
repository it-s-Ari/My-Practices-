Given a matrix of bits, this program calculates the area of the largest rectangle found in the matrix. 
All elements in a regtangle must be 1.

e.g., consider the following matrix:

      1 1 0 0 
      1 1 1 0
      1 1 1 1
      0 0 1 1
The area of the largest rectangle found in the 2nd and 3rd lines is 6.
