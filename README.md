This async program gets input from a user for a group of crypto contracts (e.g., NOTUSDT), then fetches prices from two 
    exchanges, Binance and KuCoin, then shows the price from each and the average. It is async in order to maximize aaccuracy
    by avoiding lags.
cons: no strong error handling. This can be improved.
